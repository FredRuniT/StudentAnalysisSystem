# Blueprint Integration Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Data Model Foundation (Week 1)

### 1.1 Create Scaffolding Data Models
- [ ] Parse JSON structure from `/Data/Standards/*.json`
- [ ] Create `ScaffoldingDocument` Swift model
- [ ] Create `LearningExpectations` model with Knowledge/Understanding/Skills
- [ ] Create `StandardProgression` model for grade-to-grade connections
- [ ] Implement JSON decoders for all scaffolding documents

### 1.2 Define Missing Core Types
- [ ] Create `ValidatedCorrelationModel` wrapping `CorrelationModel` with confidence metrics
- [ ] Create `LearningObjective` struct with standard alignment
- [ ] Create `PredictedOutcome` struct for future impact predictions
- [ ] Create `Milestone` struct for 9-week checkpoints
- [ ] Create `ProgressEvaluation` model for tracking

### 1.3 Update Existing Models
- [ ] Add missing `InterventionType` cases: `intensiveSupport`, `targetedIntervention`, `regularSupport`
- [ ] Fix access levels in `ILPGenerator` (private → internal/public)
- [ ] Ensure all models conform to `Codable` and `Sendable`

## Phase 2: Blueprint Integration Engine (Week 2)

### 2.1 Enhance BlueprintManager
- [ ] Load and parse all scaffolding documents from `/Data/Standards/`
- [ ] Create mapping between components and scaffolding standards
- [ ] Implement grade progression lookups
- [ ] Add methods to retrieve K/U/S expectations for any standard

### 2.2 Complete GradeProgressionAnalyzer
- [ ] Fix type references to use proper models
- [ ] Implement correlation-based progression predictions
- [ ] Create phased intervention planning (Immediate/Short-term/Long-term)
- [ ] Generate milestone dates based on 9-week intervals

### 2.3 Fix ILPGenerator+Blueprint
- [ ] Replace undefined types with proper models
- [ ] Implement methods using scaffolding documents
- [ ] Create learning objectives from K/U/S expectations
- [ ] Generate predicted outcomes from correlation data

## Phase 3: Progress Tracking System (Week 3)

### 3.1 Create Progress Tracker Module
```swift
Sources/ProgressTracking/
├── Models/
│   ├── ProgressEvaluation.swift
│   ├── EvaluationCriteria.swift
│   └── ProgressTimeline.swift
├── Services/
│   ├── ProgressTracker.swift
│   ├── EvaluationManager.swift
│   └── MilestoneValidator.swift
└── Storage/
    └── ProgressRepository.swift
```

### 3.2 Implement 9-Week Evaluation System
- [ ] Create evaluation forms for each milestone
- [ ] Link to report card periods
- [ ] Support teacher and parent input
- [ ] Calculate progress against predicted outcomes

### 3.3 Build Feedback Loop
- [ ] Store evaluation results
- [ ] Update correlation confidence based on actual progress
- [ ] Refine future predictions
- [ ] Adjust ILP recommendations dynamically

## Phase 4: User Interface Components (Week 4)

### 4.1 Student Profile View
```swift
StudentProfileView
├── ProfileHeaderView (name, grade, school)
├── TabView
│   ├── AssessmentTab
│   │   └── Component scores, proficiency levels
│   ├── ILPTab
│   │   └── Current plan, objectives, strategies
│   └── ProgressTrackerTab
│       └── Timeline, evaluations, charts
```

### 4.2 Progress Timeline View
- [ ] Visual timeline with 9-week markers
- [ ] Milestone completion indicators
- [ ] Progress charts by component/standard
- [ ] Comparative analysis (expected vs actual)

### 4.3 Evaluation Input Forms
- [ ] Teacher evaluation form
- [ ] Parent observation form
- [ ] Student self-assessment (age-appropriate)
- [ ] File attachment support (work samples)

## Phase 5: Testing & Validation (Week 5)

### 5.1 Unit Tests
- [ ] Test scaffolding document parsing
- [ ] Test correlation → standard mapping
- [ ] Test milestone generation
- [ ] Test progress calculations

### 5.2 Integration Tests
- [ ] Full flow: Assessment → ILP → Progress
- [ ] 9-week evaluation cycle
- [ ] Feedback loop validation
- [ ] Multi-student batch processing

### 5.3 Performance Testing
- [ ] Load test with 25,946 students
- [ ] Correlation lookup optimization
- [ ] UI responsiveness with large datasets

## Phase 6: Deployment & Documentation (Week 6)

### 6.1 Build & Deploy
- [ ] Run `xcodegen generate`
- [ ] Build for macOS and iOS
- [ ] Create release builds
- [ ] Package for distribution

### 6.2 Documentation
- [ ] API documentation for all new types
- [ ] User guide for progress tracking
- [ ] Teacher training materials
- [ ] Parent portal instructions

## Key Deliverables

1. **Scaffolding Integration**: Full K/U/S expectations in ILPs
2. **Validated Correlations**: Confidence metrics on all predictions  
3. **Learning Objectives**: Measurable, standard-aligned goals
4. **Progress Tracking**: 9-week evaluation system with feedback
5. **Student Profiles**: Comprehensive view with timeline

## Success Metrics

- ✅ All 1,117 components map to standards
- ✅ 623,286 correlations have confidence metrics
- ✅ ILPs generate for all 25,946 students
- ✅ Progress tracking supports full school year
- ✅ UI displays all data within 2 seconds

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Missing scaffolding data | Use `missing_scaffolding_documents.json` as fallback |
| Performance with large datasets | Implement pagination and lazy loading |
| Complex 9-week scheduling | Allow flexible milestone dates |
| Teacher adoption | Provide comprehensive training materials |

## Timeline Summary

- **Week 1**: Data models and type definitions
- **Week 2**: Blueprint integration engine
- **Week 3**: Progress tracking system
- **Week 4**: User interface implementation
- **Week 5**: Testing and validation
- **Week 6**: Deployment and documentation

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Parse scaffolding JSON files and create Swift models
2. Define the missing types (ValidatedCorrelationModel, LearningObjective, etc.)
3. Fix compilation errors in ILPGenerator+Blueprint.swift
4. Build and test the core integration
