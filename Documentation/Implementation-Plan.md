## Phase 3: Progress Tracking System (Week 3)

### 3.1 Create Progress Tracker Module
```swift

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ProgressTimeline.swift
â”œâ”€â”€ Services/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ProgressTracker.swift
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ EvaluationManager.swift
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ MilestoneValidator.swift
â””â”€â”€ Storage/
    â””â”€â”€ ProgressRepository.swift
```

### 3.2 Implement 9-Week Evaluation System
- [ ] Create evaluation forms for each milestone
- [ ] Link to report card periods
- [ ] Support teacher and parent input
- [ ] Calculate progress against predicted outcomes

### 3.3 Build Feedback Loop
- [ ] Store evaluation results
- [ ] Update correlation confidence based on actual progress
- [ ] Refine future predictions
- [ ] Adjust ILP recommendations dynamically

## Phase 4: User Interface Components (Week 4)

### 4.1 Student Profile View
```swift
StudentProfileView
â”œâ”€â”€ ProfileHeaderView (name, grade, school)
â”œâ”€â”€ TabView
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ AssessmentTab
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Component scores, proficiency levels
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ILPTab
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Current plan, objectives, strategies
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ProgressTrackerTab
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Timeline, evaluations, charts
```

### 4.2 Progress Timeline View
- [ ] Visual timeline with 9-week markers
- [ ] Milestone completion indicators
- [ ] Progress charts by component/standard
- [ ] Comparative analysis (expected vs actual)

### 4.3 Evaluation Input Forms
- [ ] Teacher evaluation form
- [ ] Parent observation form
- [ ] Student self-assessment (age-appropriate)
- [ ] File attachment support (work samples)

## Phase 5: Testing & Validation (Week 5)

### 5.1 Unit Tests
- [ ] Test scaffolding document parsing
- [ ] Test correlation â†’ standard mapping
- [ ] Test milestone generation
- [ ] Test progress calculations

### 5.2 Integration Tests

## Key Deliverables

1. **Scaffolding Integration**: Full K/U/S expectations in ILPs
2. **Validated Correlations**: Confidence metrics on all predictions  
3. **Learning Objectives**: Measurable, standard-aligned goals
4. **Progress Tracking**: 9-week evaluation system with feedback
5. **Student Profiles**: Comprehensive view with timeline

## Success Metrics

- âœ… All 1,117 components map to standards
- âœ… 623,286 correlations have confidence metrics
- âœ… ILPs generate for all 25,946 students
- âœ… Progress tracking supports full school year
- âœ… UI displays all data within 2 seconds

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Missing scaffolding data | Use `missing_scaffolding_documents.json` as fallback |
| Performance with large datasets | Implement pagination and lazy loading |
| Complex 9-week scheduling | Allow flexible milestone dates |
| Teacher adoption | Provide comprehensive training materials |
