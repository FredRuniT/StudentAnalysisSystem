# Test Blueprints 101
## 2021-2022 Design Updates

Test blueprints are designed to show educators a summary of what will be assessed on each assessment and may be used to help educators as they plan for the upcoming school year. The blueprints describe the content and structure of an assessment and define the ideal percentage of operational test items by reporting category for the Mississippi Academic Assessment Program (MAAP).

### A test blueprint is a tool that provides the plan for what a test will measure and guides all subsequent steps of test construction.

## Reporting Categories

Reporting categories are groups of similar standards that are assessed within each grade and subject.
- For example, in Mathematics, some reporting categories include The Number System (NS), Expressions and Equations (EE), Functions (F), Geometry (G), and Statistics and Probability (SP).
- These sets of standards can be used to identify each student's relative strengths or areas for improvement in different subdomains of a content area.
- Student performance within a reporting category indicates how proficient a student is with that subdomain of content.

## Standards Available for Assessment

Standards Available for Assessment are a list of standards from the MS College- and Career- Readiness Standards that may become items on a MAAP assessment.

## Percentage of Points by Reporting Category

- MAAP blueprints have shifted to a percentage of points per reporting category.
- This shift allows for the following:
  - Flexibility in meeting sound psychometric test construction parameters, and
  - Availability of items and/or item types within or across reporting categories.

## Total Items, Points, & Testing Time

- MAAP Blueprints now feature the total number of items and points on a test. This includes the number of operational and field test items.
- Likewise, the total testing time has also been included.

## Operational Form Development Notes

To meet the United States Department of Education's Peer Review Report requirements, operational form development notes have been added to the blueprint documents. These include Depth of Knowledge (DOK) and item type test construction goals.

## How they can be used in the classroom?

### Curriculum Design
**MAKE INFORMED INSTRUCTIONAL DECISIONS**

- Unpack the MS College- and Career-Readiness Standards (MS-CCRS).
- Identify alignment between High Quality Instructional Materials (HQIM) and test blueprints to ensure all standards are addressed.

### Instructional Planning
**DEEP DIVE INTO CONTENT STANDARDS**

- Plan classroom activities that:
  - allow students to engage in grade level content; and
  - are both rigorous and vastly covers various Depth of Knowledge (DOK) levels of cognitive complexity.

### Local Assessments
**FOCUS ON THE CONTENT**

- Design common assessments based on the units of instruction that assess the rigorous content at the various DOK levels.
