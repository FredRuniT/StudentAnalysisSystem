# Individual Learning Plan (ILP) Generation Feature

## Overview
The ILP Generation feature creates personalized learning plans for students based on assessment data, correlation analysis, and Mississippi academic standards. Plans adapt to student needs with either remediation or enrichment focus.

## Purpose
- Generate data-driven individualized learning plans
- Identify specific learning gaps and strengths
- Map weaknesses to targeted interventions
- Create grade progression paths
- Support both struggling and advanced students

### Core Implementation
- `Sources/IndividualLearningPlan/ILPGenerator.swift` - Main ILP generation logic
- `Sources/IndividualLearningPlan/ILPGenerator+Blueprint.swift` - Blueprint integration extensions
- `Sources/IndividualLearningPlan/ILPExporter.swift` - Export to multiple formats

### Data Models
- `Sources/IndividualLearningPlan/Models/ILPModels.swift` - ILP data structures
- `Sources/IndividualLearningPlan/Models/StandardsMapping.swift` - Standards alignment

### Supporting Services
- `Sources/IndividualLearningPlan/StandardsRepository.swift` - Standards data access
- `Sources/PredictiveModeling/EarlyWarningSystem.swift` - Risk prediction
- `Sources/StatisticalEngine/CorrelationAnalyzer.swift` - Correlation analysis

## Key Features

### 1. Automatic Plan Type Detection
```swift
// Automatically determines remediation vs enrichment
let ilp = await ilpGenerator.generateILP(
    student: studentData,
    correlationModel: validatedModel
)
```

### 2. Remediation Plans
For students scoring below proficiency:
- Identifies weak areas with gap analysis
- Maps to prerequisite standards
- Creates intensive intervention strategies
- Generates scaffolded learning objectives
- Predicts future risks without intervention

### 3. Enrichment Plans
For advanced students (>85% or Level 5):
- Maps strengths to next-grade standards
- Creates acceleration opportunities
- Suggests project-based learning
- Identifies areas for competition prep
- Predicts future excellence areas

### 4. Blueprint Integration
- Uses test blueprints for standard alignment
- Incorporates K/U/S scaffolding
- Prioritizes based on test weights
- Creates grade-specific objectives

### 5. Multi-Format Export
```swift
let exporter = ILPExporter()

// Export formats
exporter.exportToMarkdown(ilp, to: "ilp.md")
exporter.exportToHTML(ilp, to: "ilp.html")
exporter.exportToJSON(ilp, to: "ilp.json")
exporter.exportToCSV([ilp], to: "ilps.csv")
```

## ILP Structure

### Core Components
1. **Student Information**
   - MSIS ID, name, grade, school
   - Assessment date and type

2. **Performance Summary**
   - Overall score and proficiency level
   - Component scores breakdown
   - Strength and weak areas

3. **Learning Objectives**
   - Standard-aligned goals
   - Three-phase scaffolding (K/U/S)
   - Success criteria
   - Time estimates

4. **Intervention Strategies**
   - Tier (Universal/Strategic/Intensive)
   - Frequency and duration
   - Group size recommendations
   - Instructional approaches
   - Progress monitoring

5. **Timeline**
   - Start and end dates
   - Milestones with assessments
   - 9-week checkpoints

## Usage Workflow

1. **Initialize Generator**
```swift
let ilpGenerator = ILPGenerator(
    standardsRepository: standardsRepo,
    correlationEngine: correlationEngine,
    warningSystem: earlyWarningSystem,
    blueprintManager: blueprintManager
)
```

2. **Generate ILP**
```swift
let ilp = try await ilpGenerator.generateEnhancedILP(
    student: studentData,
    correlationModel: correlationModel,
    longitudinalData: historicalData,
    targetGrade: nextGrade
)
```

3. **Export Results**
```swift
let exporter = ILPExporter()
try exporter.exportToMarkdown(ilp, to: outputPath)
```
