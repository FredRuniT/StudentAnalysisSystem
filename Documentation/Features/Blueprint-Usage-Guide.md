# Blueprint Usage Guide - Following Test Blueprints 101

## Overview
Based on the Mississippi Test Blueprints 101 guidelines, our system uses blueprints to create targeted Individual Learning Plans (ILPs) that prepare students for the next grade level.

## How Blueprints Guide Our Analysis

### 1. Reporting Categories
The system groups standards into reporting categories for targeted intervention:

**Mathematics Example (Grade 3)**:
- **Operations & Algebraic Thinking (OA)**: 37-46% of test
- **Number & Operations Base Ten (NBT)**: 12-17% of test  
- **Number & Operations Fractions (NF)**: 13-19% of test
- **Measurement & Data (MD)**: 21-29% of test
- **Geometry (G)**: 4-12% of test

**ELA Example (Grade 3)**:
- **Reading Literature (RL)**: Major emphasis
- **Reading Informational (RI)**: Major emphasis
- **Language (L)**: Supporting emphasis

### 2. Student Performance Mapping

When a student scores poorly on component **D1OP** (Operations), the system:
1. Maps to **Operations & Algebraic Thinking** reporting category
2. Identifies standards **3.OA.1-9** that need focus
3. Pulls specific learning expectations:
   - **Knowledge**: "Multiplication means 'groups of'"
   - **Understanding**: "Properties of multiplication solve problems"  
   - **Skills**: "Solve two-step word problems"

### 3. Grade Progression Planning

The system uses correlations to predict future impacts:
```
Grade 3 D1OP (weak) → 95% correlation → Grade 5 D3OP struggles
```

This means a student weak in Grade 3 Operations will likely struggle with Grade 5 Operations.

## Classroom Implementation

### Curriculum Design
**MAKE INFORMED INSTRUCTIONAL DECISIONS**

The system unpacks MS-CCRS standards automatically:
- Identifies alignment between test components and standards
- Shows which standards need the most attention based on test weight
- Prioritizes high-percentage reporting categories

Example Output:
```
Priority 1: Operations & Algebraic Thinking (46% of test)
- Focus Standards: 3.OA.1-9
- Time Allocation: 8-12 weeks
- Key Skills: Multiplication facts, word problems
```

### Instructional Planning  
**DEEP DIVE INTO CONTENT STANDARDS**

The system generates activities at various DOK levels:

**DOK 1 (Recall)**:
- Multiplication flashcards
- Skip counting practice

**DOK 2 (Skill/Concept)**:
- Apply properties to solve problems
- Create arrays and models

**DOK 3 (Strategic Thinking)**:
- Multi-step word problems
- Explain solution strategies

**DOK 4 (Extended Thinking)**:
- Create original problems
- Teach concepts to peers

### Local Assessments
**FOCUS ON THE CONTENT**

The system recommends assessment strategies:
- **Formative**: Weekly checks on priority standards
- **Summative**: Monthly assessments aligned to reporting categories
- **Performance Tasks**: Based on DOK 3-4 standards

## Example Student Analysis

### Input: Grade 3 Student Performance
```
Math Components:
- D1OP: 35% (Basic) - Operations & Algebraic Thinking
- D3NBT: 68% (Passing) - Number & Operations Base Ten
- D5NF: 42% (Basic) - Fractions
```

### Blueprint Analysis:
1. **Weak Area**: Operations (D1OP) - represents 37-46% of Grade 4 test
2. **Impact**: Strong correlation (0.95) with Grade 5 Operations
3. **Priority**: HIGH - Major reporting category

### Generated Learning Plan:

#### Immediate Focus (Weeks 1-4)
**Standards**: 3.OA.1-3 (Multiplication concepts)
- **What to Know**: Multiplication as equal groups
- **Activities**: 
  - Manipulatives for grouping
  - Skip counting 2s, 5s, 10s
  - Array building exercises

#### Short-term Development (Weeks 5-12)
**Standards**: 3.OA.4-7 (Properties & Patterns)
- **What to Understand**: Commutative & associative properties
- **Activities**:
  - Property application problems
  - Pattern recognition in multiplication table
  - Word problem solving

#### Grade 4 Preparation (Weeks 13-20)
**Standards**: Bridge to 4.OA.1-5
- **Preview**: Multi-digit multiplication
- **Activities**:
  - Area models for larger numbers
  - Two-step problem practice
  - Factor pairs exploration

## Reporting Category Percentages Usage

The system weighs interventions based on test percentages:

```python
Priority Score = (Test Percentage × Performance Gap)

Example:
- Operations: 46% test weight × 65% gap = 29.9 priority points
- Geometry: 12% test weight × 30% gap = 3.6 priority points
```

This ensures students focus on areas that:
1. Have the highest test impact
2. Show the greatest need for improvement

## Standards Available for Assessment

The system only recommends standards that can be assessed:
- All recommended standards come from MS-CCRS
- Each standard has specific assessment criteria
- Performance indicators are clearly defined

## Operational Form Development

Following USDE Peer Review requirements, the system:
1. **Tracks DOK Levels**: Ensures balance across cognitive complexity
2. **Item Type Variety**: Recommends different assessment formats
3. **Psychometric Alignment**: Uses correlation data to validate predictions

## Benefits of Blueprint Integration

1. **Targeted Intervention**: Focus on high-impact reporting categories
2. **Test Alignment**: Practice matches actual test structure
3. **Grade Progression**: Smooth transition to next grade expectations
4. **Data-Driven**: Uses actual correlation data from 25,946 students
5. **Standards-Based**: All recommendations tied to MS-CCRS

## Teacher Dashboard View

```
Student: John Doe
Grade: 3
Next Grade Readiness: 62%

Critical Focus Areas:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Operations & Algebraic Thinking         │
│ Test Weight: 37-46%                     │
│ Current Performance: 35% (Basic)        │
│ Standards to Master: 3.OA.1-9           │

Recommended Actions:
1. Daily: Multiplication facts practice (DOK 1)
2. Weekly: Word problem solving (DOK 2-3)  
3. Monthly: Performance assessment (DOK 3-4)
```

## Conclusion

By following Test Blueprints 101 guidelines, the system ensures:
- **Curriculum Design**: Aligned to test structure
- **Instructional Planning**: Varied DOK levels
- **Local Assessments**: Blueprint-based design
- **Grade Progression**: Correlation-driven preparation

This creates a comprehensive learning path that prepares each student for success in their next grade level.
