# Blueprint Integration Feature

## Overview
The Blueprint Integration feature maps Mississippi MAAP Test Blueprints to student assessment data, enabling targeted interventions based on official test specifications and standards.

## Purpose
- Maps weak assessment components to specific MS-CCRS standards
- Extracts Knowledge, Understanding, and Skills (K/U/S) expectations
- Uses test weight percentages to prioritize interventions
- Creates grade progression paths using correlation predictions

- `Sources/AnalysisCore/Models/Blueprint.swift` - Blueprint data models
- `Sources/AnalysisCore/Services/BlueprintManager.swift` - Manages blueprint loading and access
- `Sources/AnalysisCore/Models/BlueprintTypes.swift` - Supporting types for blueprint integration
- `Sources/IndividualLearningPlan/ILPGenerator+Blueprint.swift` - Blueprint-enhanced ILP generation

### Data Models
- `Sources/AnalysisCore/Models/ScaffoldingModels.swift` - K/U/S scaffolding structures
- `Sources/AnalysisCore/Models/MississippiProficiencyLevels.swift` - Official proficiency levels

### Grade Progression
- `Sources/PredictiveModeling/GradeProgressionAnalyzer.swift` - Analyzes multi-grade progression paths

## Key Features

### 1. Blueprint Loading
```swift
let blueprintManager = BlueprintManager.shared
try blueprintManager.loadAllBlueprints()
let blueprint = blueprintManager.getBlueprint(grade: 4, subject: "MATH")
```

### 2. Component to Standard Mapping
- Maps test components (D1OP, D2OP, etc.) to reporting categories
- Links reporting categories to specific MS-CCRS standards
- Example: D1OP → Operations & Algebraic Thinking → Standards 4.OA.1-9

### 3. Scaffolding Integration
- Loads K/U/S expectations from `/Data/Standards/*.json`
- Creates three-phase learning objectives:
  - Knowledge: What students need to know
  - Understanding: What students need to understand  
  - Skills: What students need to do

### 4. Weight-Based Prioritization
- Uses blueprint test weights to prioritize interventions
- Focus on high-weight categories (>25% of test)
- Adjusts intervention intensity based on component importance

## Usage Example

```swift
// Generate blueprint-enhanced ILP
let ilpGenerator = ILPGenerator(
    blueprintManager: BlueprintManager.shared,
    correlationEngine: correlationEngine
)

let ilp = try await ilpGenerator.generateEnhancedILP(
    student: studentData,
    correlationModel: validatedModel,
    targetGrade: 5
)
```

## Data Flow
1. Student assessment identifies weak components
2. BlueprintManager maps components to standards
3. ScaffoldingRepository provides K/U/S expectations
4. ILPGenerator creates targeted learning objectives
5. System generates phased intervention plan

## Configuration
Blueprints are loaded from:
- `/Data/MAAP_BluePrints/*.json` - Test specifications
- `/Data/Standards/*.json` - Scaffolding documents

## Performance Considerations
- Blueprints cached in memory after first load
- Thread-safe access via Actor pattern
- Supports concurrent blueprint queries

## Testing
- Unit tests: `Tests/AnalysisCoreTests/ScaffoldingModelsTests.swift`
- Integration with ILP generation tested in system tests

## Future Enhancements
- Dynamic blueprint updates from Mississippi DOE
- Custom blueprint creation for district assessments
- Blueprint comparison across years
- Automated standard alignment validation
